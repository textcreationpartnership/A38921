            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>ON the Ninth, about Two in the Afternoon the Enemy came out, and appeared as if they intended a Sally, but deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to ſecure a Ditch that lay betwixt them and our Batteries, which was no ſooner known, but our Men marcht down upon them, and beat them back into the Town, killing about 30, with the loſs only of one Granadeer: All this day our Guns and Mortars plaid furiouſly on the Town, and ſo continued all Night without intermiſſion; On the <hi>12th,</hi> in the Morning early came over to us one Captain <hi>Dobbins,</hi> who ſays, That yeſterday in beating the Enemy into the Town we killed two of their Majors, and one of our Bombs killed Monſieur <hi>La Four,</hi> who was Brother to the Governour, and that the Governour and Officers, to keep up the Hearts of the Town and Gariſon, aſſure them, that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet have totally beat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and forced thoſe <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Veſſels with Captain <hi>Cole</hi> into the <hi>Shannon,</hi> but that day, or within 48 hours a Squadron of <hi>French</hi> would come into the River to their Relief, and wholly deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That the Gariſon Conſiſted of about 15000, of which but 7 or 8000 were well armed, and had no Horſe, nor did any Horſe come there in the Night to Guard. All this day we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Firing, and about Six and Night the Town appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Fire, in many places; to prevent its ſpreading, the Enemy blew up Divers Houſes and Buildings, notwithſtanding which, ſome very Conſiderable Place continued burning with great violence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Two the next Morning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>11th</hi> in the Morning came to the General, ſome Officers of <hi>Cunningham</hi>'s Regiment Col. <hi>Echlin,</hi> of the loſs of their Coll. and to pray the General's Favour to have the Regiment: The ſaid Coll, Sir <hi>Albert Cunningham</hi>'s Regiment being detached from the Camp to join the Forces for the reducing of <hi>Sligo,</hi> and he ſtaying after them, did follow with Ten Men only as a Guard. In their March, upon the Hills near <hi>Boyle,</hi> they unhappily miſtook their way in a Fogg, and fell into the Hands of 2 or 300 <hi>Rapparees,</hi> to whom they ſold their Lives at the utmoſt Rate, killing about 25, but were at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour'd,
<pb facs="tcp:93399:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>and cut in pieces, whoſe Blood was ſoon reveng'd by <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick O Donnel,</hi> who was in hearing of the Guns, but came too late to ſave the Brave Coll. however he kill'd many of them, and Routed the reſt: We continued to batter and Bomb the Town all this day and all night.</p>
            <p>The <hi>12th,</hi> Laſt night and this day we continued firing into the Town without Intermiſſion. This Morning came to us Ten Dragoons and an Officer, Deſerters, who ſay, That in the great Fire that was in the Town on the Tenth at night, the Bombs ſet Fire to Three Magazines; one of Powder, which in blowing up, ſet Fire unto, and burnt great part of the <hi>Engliſh Town,</hi> and much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſchiefs, the other two of Beef, Bisket, Oates, Brandy and Wine, which was all deſtroy'd, and would be ſoon wanted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>
            <p>The Weather hitherto continues very good; the Breach in the Wall is very wide, and is every moment wider: Our Guns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually firing thereat, which gives us hopes of being Maſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in a very few days, above half the Town being already ruin'd with our Ball, Bombs, Carcaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Men are Impatient to Storm, but when it will be we know not, all things being kept ſecret until put in Action.</p>
            <p>The <hi>13th.</hi> the General ſent an Expreſs to the Queen, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all day to Batter the Town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>14th</hi> the General ſent two Regiments towards <hi>Clonmell</hi> and <hi>Waterford</hi> to reinforce the Militia, there being many Priſoners at the latter, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in thoſe parts become Inſolent. His Excellency hath alſo ſent Miners and Guards to ſupport them, with Orders to blow up and demoliſh Caſtle <hi>Connell</hi> and the other Caſtles we have taken near <hi>Lymerick</hi> on the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and elſewhere, to prevent their being any more Neſts of Rebels, Raparees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>15th</hi> we continued to Bomb and Batter the Town, and made the Breaches ſo wide that we plainly ſee into the Town, which looks ruinous. The Enemy have made much Sod-works, and a very deep Trench or Ditch with Palliſadoes and Stockadoes, yet the Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue impatient to ſtorm, they hoping to have had Orders to have made this night a general Aſſault, but as yet hear nothing thereof, though ſome think the Camp are ready for the work in all points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dublin</hi> the <hi>17th.</hi> This night was Publiſhed a Proclamation of the Lords Juſtices for a full and free Pardon to all Raparees and others in Arms againſt the Government, provided they come in and lay down their Arms in 20 days, otherwiſe to be excluded from Mercy, and not only leave given for any Perſon to kill them, but a reward of 40 <hi>s.</hi> for each Head brought in, Which ſhall immediately be paid by the next Juſtice of Peace, and the publick Revenue to reimburſe it, which it's thought will be an effectual way to clear the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and prove more advantageous than droves of Cattel to the Raparee Hunters.</p>
